## Chapter 1

### 1.1 Introduction

We live in the modern age of computer technology. Even though the act of purchasing and online shopping does not have a long track record, it is the fastest growing and dominating business model and technology area. Companies like Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, and Walmart currently dominate the market. However, online shopping is not very common in our country, and we can understand the potential of this business in our country's case. It is significant to develop a proper system that could resolve the current online shopping drawbacks.

The main geographical target of this project is our beloved country Ethiopia. We aim to design and implement a reliable online shopping system for local use here in Ethiopia.

### 1.2 Background of the Project

Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce that allows consumers to buy goods or services from sellers over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Online shopping has become a popular and convenient way of shopping for millions of people around the world, especially with the development of various online platforms, payment methods, and delivery services. However, online shopping did not emerge overnight; it has a history that dates to the late 1970s.

The growth of online shopping was further boosted by the invention of the World Wide Web in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, who also created the first web browser. The World Wide Web made it possible for users to access information and resources from different servers and locations. In 1994, Netscape developed a security protocol called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) that encrypted the data exchanged between web browsers and web servers, making online transactions more secure and reliable. In the same year, the first online marketplaces, such as Amazon.com and eBay, were launched, offering a wide range of products and services to online shoppers.Â Since then, online shopping has evolved and expanded to include various features, such as comparison shopping, social commerce, mobile commerce, and more.

Online shopping is still in its early stages in Ethiopia, but it is growing rapidly. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies, and the Ethiopian government is taking steps to support the development of e-commerce.Â A regulation called 'Electronic Transaction' that provides a legal framework for Electronic Commerce (E-commerce) and other related aspects including e-receipts is in the final approval process.Â The long-awaited Payment instrument Issuers directives that were expected to open the mobile money and fintech space for non-banks and MFIs are issued now. Ethio Telecom or any other local Fin-tech start-ups and companies can operate legally.Â This will definitively add to the dynamics of the Fintech landscape and hopefully provide more and better avenues for people to buy online.

There are a few e-commerce websites and apps in Ethiopia that are worth exploring.Â Shega is a website that provides a list of e-commerce websites and apps in Ethiopia.Â Addis Mercato is an online marketplace that offers a wide range of products from supermarkets and stores in town.

### 1.3 Statement of the Problem

The main issues of online shopping in Ethiopia are accountability and legal processes, security, delivery, and a money back guarantee on failure or conflict. The proposed software solution aims to solve these issues.

- **Accountability and legal processes:**
Accountability should be taken for handling items and money with proper legal processes prepared to handle all cases. Customers and vendors would like to have the legal processes handled by the company with less of their involvement. Also, the company should ensure that vendors comply with local laws and regulations.
- **Security issues:**
Some vendors might try to scam customers and create multiple accounts. The company should verify vendors' and customers' existence to avoid scams.The system must be designed to protect unauthorized identity information access and must keep backups.
- **Delivery issues:**
Accidents or conflicts might arise during delivery of items. The company ought to have a system in place to handle this.As for thefts during delivery the deliverer ought to be accountable.
- **Money Back Guarantee on Failure or Conflict:**
Local payment methods such as CBE Birr, Amole, Tele birr, and M-Birr do not provide an API for a 2-phase payment system in which paid money is reserved until completion of item transaction either in success or failure. Customers would like to have the guarantee of their money being returned back safely, and without bureaucracy, to them on failure.
- **Internet Issues:**
Internet requirement is unavoidable but the system might be overloaded with command and fetch requests. The more resource files need to be transferred the more load the system will take thus the slower the service.

### 1.4 Justification of the Project

It is best to make this project as no local system provides a solution for all  the issues mentioned in the problem statement and the ones that do are not local and do not support local payment or delivery.

### 1.5 Objective of the Project

#### 1.5.1 General Objectives

Generally, our objective is to create a desirable, competent, secure, and reliable local online shopping software system for use in Ethiopia.

#### 1.5.2 Specific Objectives

Our specific objectives are:

- To create a functional online shopping system within the given time-frame.
- To incrementally and iteratively design and build the system.
- To simultaneously work on this project for maximum efficiency.
- To continuously, analyze and improve requirements and this specification document.
- To analyze, design, and implement features prioritized based on importance.

### 1.6 Scope and Limitations

#### 1.6.1 Scope of the Project

In this project, we only focus on developing a country-local system.

#### 1.6.2 Limitations of the Project

These are the limitations of this project:

- The software system will not work internationally.
- Internet access and a modern browser is required.
- Less than one month to finish this project.

### 1.7 Feasibility Study

#### 1.7.1 Technical Feasibility

It is possible to do this project using the modern softwares and tools available to us at this time. We have access to personal computers, great coding and editing softwares, good internet access, a lot of frameworks, libraries and resources for web development.

#### 1.7.2 Operational Feasibility

Node.js is best for this project as it is the latest web-technology and provides a variety of good well-maintained libraries and development tools.

This project can be deployed on a node.js server or on a virtual system server. And it should have a much better performance than the usual PHP server.

Thus it is possible to deploy and maintain this project using the technologies currently available to us.

#### 1.7.3 Economic Feasibility

This project requires an owning company to operate and maintain it. It requires legal action and accountability, software maintenance and upgrade. Thus it requires employees. It is possible to make this project operational and actively available to users if investors are willing to invest the required amount of funds to create and maintain the company.

### 1.8 Significance of the Project

This project is significant because:

- It makes it easier to find the items we want to buy and their details using modern technology.
- It will be trustworthy and involves the least legal processes and worries to customers.
- It will be most demanded in large cities such as Addis Abeba.

### 1.9 Beneficiaries of the Project

The beneficiaries of this project are:

- Stakeholders who invest in this project.
- Vendors who want to keep track of their inventory and sell online.
- Customers who want to purchase online and have items delivered.
- Employees, such as Managers and couriers.

### 1.10 Methodology

#### 1.10.1 Requirement Elicitation Methods

We used interview, online research, and group discussion methods to gather and form software requirements for this project. We have viewed and analyzed some of the local and international most used online shopping websites like Amazon and Tolo Mart. We have also done some research on the proclamations regarding trading and national payment systems in Ethiopia.

#### 1.10.2 Software Development Method

We use Agile model which has an incremental and iterative approach to software development. We aim to develop the system within a very short amount of time with as much features implemented as possible. We use modern version control tools like git and Github to aid us in collaboration and in incremental and iterative software development.

All provide account profile creation and management.

- **Delivery:**
Some provide delivery services of products/items with some supporting pay-on-deliver.

- **Additional features:**
Most provide product/item reviews and ratings from other customers. Some provide customer support such as hot-lines.

### 2.2 Users of the Existing Systems

The existing systems provide services for local customers in Ethiopia. Most of the customers that use them are located in Addis Abeba or similar large cities in the country.

### 2.3 Drawbacks of the Existing Systems

Some only provide shopping of specific categories of products/items such as cars or food. Some do not provide internet payment methods. Most do not provide money-back-guarantee.

## Chapter 3 | Proposed System

The proposed system for the project is described in Chapter 3 of this Communication. The first step is to define business rules, followed by describing functional requirements such as users and user accounts, payment and item exchange. The chapter then goes on to investigate the non functional requirements, which include operational, legal, user interface, performance, reliability, error handling and security.In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the proposed system, the system model is also presented, including scenarios, use case diagrams, entity relationships diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and state diagrams.

- The UI should have sooth transition between states in order to provide a good user experience.

#### 3.4.4 Performance Considerations

The system has to be able to handle many requests as fast as possible. This means less data transfer balanced with less processing time. Rather than use a backend page generator like PHP to generate dynamic pages it might be best to generate the page on the frontend using libraries such as React.js and get the necessary data from the server using requests. The former takes more processing time on the backend server while the later takes less processing time on the backend server.

#### 3.4.5 Reliability

The system must provide all implemented features as stated in the requirement to be reliable. And handle failing cases and runtime errors properly with solutions and fallbacks.

#### 3.4.6 Error Handling

Three types of errors are expected to occur in this system.

- Errors regarding user input mistakes and validation
- Errors on the frontend client
- Errors on the backend server

Errors regarding user input mistakes and validation should to be handled on the frontend and backend. On the frontend users should be notified of their input mistakes and errors and must enter valid inputs before this input data can be sent to the server. And on the backend server the data assumed to be valid must be checked and validated for exploitive and harmful attacks such as SQL injections.

Errors on the frontend client include errors such as errors regarding data fetching, errors regarding data presentation. These are errors related to the frontend library and fetching data from the server. Proper handling of this type of errors
must be implemented to provide a good user experience. For example upon fetching error an error indicator must be provided in place of where the fetched data is supposed to be populated.

Errors on the backend server include unhandled exceptions and mistakes that cause the server to crash under some circumstances. Backend developers must handle all exceptions properly and avoid mistakes that would cause the server to crash. Tests should be prepared and done where possible.

#### 3.4.7 Security

The security concerns to be considered for this system are creating secure connections between client and server, secure storage of password and other sensitive data, preventing SQL injections, detecting and dealing with attacks such as DDoS attacks, differentiating between bots and real users and blocking bots from spamming.

Secure connections need to be made between the client and server in order to transfer all sensitive data securely. This is a solved problem in the web-development industry. And that solution is the `https` protocol, and it is the safest way to transfer sensitive data over the internet.

Secure storage of password can be done using good hashing. Since a password only needs to be verified on the backend server it does not need to be stored in as is. A password can be hashed and stored. Since it is very difficult to calculate the password from the hash it is best to store passwords hashed. And when there is a security fault or breach there can be enough time for users to change their passwords and secure their accounts.

As for other sensitive data where hashing is not an option the security concern is at the host and how the admins are accessing the host. Thus a strong password and multi-factor authentication should be used.

To prevent SQL and other forms of injections on the backend security measures must be taken when handling requests to detect and reject requests containing injected data.

DDoS attacks are deadly to the system's service. Measure must be taken to detect and prevent DDoS attacks such as timeouts.

Bots and spamming can be prevented using Captchas.

## Chapter 4 | System Design

### 4.1 Overview

After analysis modeling the next step is creating system design based on that analysis models.

### 4.2 System Architecture

The architecture model that is best to use for this project is a hybrid MVC and server-client architecture model. The MVC architecture is on the client side and since there is client-server communication there is also a server-client architecture model.

One of the best software out there at this time are Node.js and React.js which are best fit for this architecture model. React.js offers a dynamic client-side MVC functionality and Node.js offers single-threaded high performance backend servers such as Hapi.js and a lot of 3rd party library support.

#### 4.2.1 Subsystem Decomposition

The overall system now has to be decomposed into subsystems. The subsystems of this system are user management system, employee management system, session management system, email token-verification system, delivery management system, vendor-stock management system, payment system, item-cart system, item search and filter system.

#### 4.2.2 Hardware and Software Mapping

The subsystems are going to be deployed on certain hardwares. Here are the software hardware mappings:

- user management system, employee management system, session management system, email token-verification system, delivery management system, vendor-stock management system, payment system, item-cart system, item search and filter system.

#### 4.2.3 Component Diagram

<!-- ![deployment-diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nati8333/online_shopping_webapp/main/software%20requirement/spec/media/deployment/deployment-diagram..drawiosvg)   -->

#### 4.2.5 Persistent Data Management

Persistent data in this system include database records, images and other attachment files. The database will be managed locally on the server using DBMS such as MySQL and accessed and modified through an API. Image and other attachment files are stored in the filesystem and privately accessed through a properly authorized request router.

#### 4.2.6 Database Design

The database can be design using a great tool such as MySQL Workbench which provides all the features needed for fast and reliable database design. It provides visual diagraming, backward and forward engineering features among other basic features.

##### 4.2.7 Entity Relationship Diagram

![entity-relationship--ER](media/entity-relationship/on-shop-EER-UML.svg)  

<!-- ![entity-relationship--ER](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nati8333/online_shopping_webapp/main/software%20requirement/spec/media/entity-relationship/on-shop-EER-UML.svg)   -->

#### 4.2.8 Access Control

Access to database will be managed mainly by the provided MySQL server access control system and using predefined procedures and selective access grants.

Access to images and other attachment files will be stored in a private directory and managed by a router on the backend server which fulfills requests based on proper authorizations.

**Access Matrix**:

> Let DB stand for Database and PRM stand for Private Resource Manager.  
> PRM.Attachment represents image files or other attachments files.

The programming languages to be used are HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript.

#### HTML Coding Standards

- HTML-5 should be used.
- Tags and attributes should be broken into on a new line if the line-character-count exceeds 100.
- Start and end tags should either be on the same line, if small, or on different lines with the same indent.
- Tag attributes should be broken into new lines and indented by one more than the tags indent with the closing `>` or `/>` sign not on a new line by itself.

#### CSS Coding Standards

- CSS3 should be used.
- Selectors should be broken into on a new line if the line-character-count exceeds 100.
- Style definitions should be indented once compared to the parent indent.

### Javascript Coding Standards

- Code should be broken into a new line if the line-character-count exceeds 100.
- Braces should be on the same line at the end. like so `const foo = function() {`, `if(...) {`, `} else {`
- No spaces should be put between keyword or function name and the parenthesis after. like so `for(`, `if(`, `function foo(`
- Self-explanatory names should be chosen as compared to redundant and verbose comments.

### 5.5 Prototype

The basic prototype should implement session-management and the forms/pages prioritized from most important to least important.
The implementations should be filled with stubs and later implemented.

### 5.6 Implementation Detail

#### Authentication

- Session-cookie based authentication will be used to track session data. The session cookie will be created if the user has logged in with valid credentials.

## Chapter 6 | Testing

### 6.1 Introduction

Unit tests can be prepared and used to test individual components of the system where unit testing is required. And integration testing can either be prepared code or user interaction testing and the least required regression testing should be done with each integration.

### 6.2 Scope

Testing should focus on error/bug avoidance, exception handling and providing a good user experience.

### 6.3 Resources

Testing libraries.

### 6.4 Schedule

Testing should be done before pushing to the central repo to ensure a working code is integrated into the system.  
Other than that regular user-interaction testing should be done to get feedback and bug reports.

### 6.5 Estimated Risk and Contingency Plan

One major risk is that sufficient testing has not been implemented and thus the system will have vulnerabilities. This can be avoided by doing enough research on features that require high security and provide very important functionality. Professional advice should be sought and considered.

In case of failure of new version of the system the system should be changed to a previous stable version. And the failing version of the system should be put under evaluation for bad test implementations.
